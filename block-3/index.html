It forms the largest and eastern portion the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal. Located at the apex of the Bay of Bengal, the country is bordered by India and Myanmar and is separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the narrow Siliguri Corridor.[8] With a population of 170 million, it is the world's eighth-most populous country, the fifth-most populous in Asia and the third-most populous Muslim-majority country. The official Bengali language is the seventh-most spoken language in the world, which Bangladesh shares with the neighboring Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam (Barak Valley).

                            <p class="text-justified">The Royal Bengal Tiger is the National Animal of Bangladesh. The Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is the most numerous tiger subspecies. By 2011, the total population was estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals with a decreasing trend. None of the 'Tiger Conservation Landscapes' within the Bengal tiger's range is considered large enough to support an effective population size of 250 adult individuals. Since 2010, it is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.[1]

                            As of 2010, Bengal tiger populations in India have been estimated at 1,706–1,909.[2] As of 2014, they had reputedly increased to an estimated 2,226 individuals,[3] but the method used in the census may not be accurate.</p>

                            <p class="text-justified">Cox's Bazzar is the longest sea beach in the world. Cox's Bazar (Bengali: কক্সবাজার, Koksbajar, Koksbazar or Kokshbajar) is a town, a fishing port and district headquarters in Bangladesh. The beach in Cox's Bazar is an unbroken 120  km sandy sea beach with a gentle slope, one of the world's longest.[2][3][4] It is located 150 km south of the industrial port Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, whose literal translation means "yellow flower." Its other old name was "Palongkee".

                            The modern Cox's Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox (died 1799), an officer of the British East India Company. Cox was appointed Superintendent of Palongkee outpost after Warren Hastings became Governor of Bengal. Captain Cox was specially mobilised to deal with a century-long conflict between Arakan refugees and local Rakhains. He embarked upon the task of rehabilitating refugees in the area and made significant progress. Captain Cox died in 1799 before he could finish his work. To commemorate his role in rehabilitation work, a market was established and named Cox's Bazar ("Cox's Market") after him.

                            Today, Cox's Bazar is one of the most-visited tourist destinations in Bangladesh, though it is not a major international tourist destination. In 2013, the Bangladesh Government formed the Tourist Police unit to better protect local and foreign tourists, as well as to look after the nature and wildlife in the tourist spots of Cox's Bazar.[5]

                            <p class="text-justified">The Sundarbans (Bengali: সুন্দরবন, Shundôrbôn) is a natural region comprising southern Bangladesh and a part in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is the largest single block of tidal halophytic mangrove forest in the world.[2][3][4] The Sundarbans covers approximately 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) most of which is in Bangladesh with the remainder in India.[5][6] The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[5]

                            Sundarbans South, East and West are three protected forests in Bangladesh. This region is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is the largest reserves for the Bengal tiger. The Sundarbans National Park is a National Park, Tiger Reserve, and a Biosphere Reserve located in the Sundarbans delta in the Indian state of West Bengal.</p>

Kuakata beach is a sandy expanse 18 kilometres (11 mi) long and 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) wide.[3] From the beach one can have an unobstructed view of both sunrise and sunset over the Bay of Bengal. 
                        The name Kuakata originated from the word 'Kua'-the Bengali word for "Well" which was dug on the sea shore by the early Rakhine settlers in quest of collecting drinking water,[4] who landed on Kuakata coast in the eighteenth century after being expelled from Arakan (Myanmar) by the Mughals.[5] Afterwards, it has become a tradition of digging Well in the neighborhoods of Rakhaine tribes for water.</p>

                        <p class="text-justified">St. Martin's Island (Bengali: সেন্ট মার্টিন্স দ্বীপ) is a small island (area only 8 km2) in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, about 9 km south of the tip of the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf peninsula, and forming the southernmost part of Bangladesh. There is a small adjoining island that is separated at high tide, called Chera Dwip. It is about 8 kilometres (5 miles) west of the northwest coast of Myanmar, at the mouth of the Naf River.

                        The first settlement started 250 years ago by Arabian sailors who named the island 'Zajira'. During British occupation the island was named St. Martin Island. During the First Anglo-Burmese War between the British and Burmese empires in 1824–1826, rival claims to the island were a major factor. The local names of the island are "Narical Gingira", also spelled "Narikel Jinjira/Jinjera", [1] which means 'Coconut Island' in Bengali, and "Daruchini Dwip". It is the only coral island in Bangladesh.</p>

It has been described as "the most impressive Muslim monuments in the whole of the Indian subcontinent."[1]

                        In mid-15th century, a Muslim colony was founded in the unfriendly mangrove forest of the Sundarbans near the coastline in the Bagerhat District by a saint-General, named Khan Jahan Ali. He preached in an affluent city during the reign of Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah, then known as 'Khalifalabad'.[2] Khan Jahan adorned this city with more than a dozen mosques, the spectacular ruins of which are focused around the most imposing and largest multidomed mosques in Bangladesh, known as the Shait-Gumbad Masjid (160'×108').[2] The construction of the mosque was started in 1442[2] and it was completed in 1459.The mosque was used for prayer purposes. It was also used as a madrasha and assembly hall.</p>
